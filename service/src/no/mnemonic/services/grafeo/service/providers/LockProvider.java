/**
 * The LockProvider interface specifies a mechanism to acquire and release a lock for a small code block. The lock
 * semantics are specific to the LockProvider implementation. The implementation may choose to only synchronize code
 * execution between multiple threads in the same process, or may choose to synchronize code execution across multiple
 * processes running on distributed nodes.
 * <p>
 * The lock must be bound to a specific 'region' to avoid accidentally locking the same key twice. If the key is the
 * same but requested for a different region the calling code will successfully acquire the lock.
 * <p>
 * Usage example:
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * try (LockProvider.Lock ignored = lockProvider.acquireLock("region", "key")) {
 *   doSomethingSynchronized();
 * }}
 * </pre>
 * {@link #acquireLock(String, String)} will acquire a lock for a given region and key and the lock will automatically
 * be released once the code execution leaves the try block. The code execution will stop until the lock is released
 * if another thread or node already holds the lock for a given region and key.
