#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/mnemonic-no/act-platform/issues).
* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** reproducing the issue.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.
* Your PR will be reviewed and we might request changes before it can be merged. Please follow up on your PRs.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

* Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability or functionality will generally not be accepted.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Start writing code. When you are done, open a pull request.
* If you intend to submit a bigger change please talk to us first if the new feature is something we would consider to include.
